Why this package uses comments instead of docstrings:

  One can only import this package through an SCons script
  (otherwise various scons modules it imports aren't
  available on sys.path).  So there's really no way to
  inspect it interactively and look at the docstrings.
  On the other hand, we can get much prettier Doxygen
  outputs by putting Doxygen markup commands in comments
  (Doxygen ignores markup in docstrings), and we expect
  people to look at the Doxygen output for help.
